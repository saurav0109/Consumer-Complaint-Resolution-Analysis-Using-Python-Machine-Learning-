# Consumer-Complaint-Resolution-Analysis-Using-Python-Machine-Learning-

# Objective: 
Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a customer dispute would occur based on complaint data, enabling proactive resolution and improved customer satisfaction.

# Data Operations:
1 - Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
2 - Extracted and engineered features such as complaint duration and date components.
3 - Handled missing values, imputed using statistical methods, and created new fields for detailed analysis.
4 - Dropped irrelevant columns and created dummy variables for categorical data.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1 - Visualized dispute distributions across various dimensions using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
2 - Analyzed disputes by product, issue type, state, response timeliness, submission method, and company response.

# Model Building and Evaluation:
1 - Scaled datasets and applied PCA for feature selection, retaining 80% of variance.
2 - Built and evaluated multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost.
3 - Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy for final prediction.
4 - Outcome: Successfully predicted customer disputes on the test dataset, enabling the business team to take preemptive action and improve customer service.
